## Project Structure

The project is organized into modules, each focusing on a specific topic:

* **`00-course-setup`:** Setup instructions and environment configuration.
* **`01-introduction-to-genai` - `21-meta`:**  Each numbered folder represents a lesson module, containing the lesson's README.md, code examples (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#), images, and translations in multiple languages (Chinese, Spanish (MX), Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (BR), Traditional Chinese).


* **`.github`:** GitHub Actions workflows for automation and code quality.
* **`docs`:**  Documentation for the website using Docsify.
* **`images`:** Static images used in the documentation and course materials.
* **`translations`:** Translations of README and lesson materials.


## Setup and Installation


Detailed setup instructions are provided in the `00-course-setup` directory.  Refer to the `README.md` and `SETUP.md` files within that directory for complete instructions, including environment setup, and dependency installation.

## Usage Instructions

Each module (`01-introduction-to-genai` through `21-meta`) has its own README.md file which contains detailed instructions and examples of usage for the related concepts and code examples in the module.  Follow these instructions within each module to work through the lessons.
